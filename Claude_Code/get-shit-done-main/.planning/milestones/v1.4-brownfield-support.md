# Milestone: v1.4.0 - Brownfield Support

**Status:** ✅ Complete
**Phases:** 9 (all complete)
**Completed:** 2026-01-13
**Duration:** December 17, 2025 - January 13, 2026

## Overview

Complete brownfield support for GSD, enabling existing codebases to adopt the GSD methodology. Added comprehensive codebase mapping, intelligent context assembly, TDD support, UAT workflows, and milestone management improvements.

## Phases Completed

### Phase 1: Templates & Structure
**Goal:** Create codebase map templates and folder structure
**Plans:** 3/3 complete
**Completed:** 2025-12-17

Created 7 brownfield templates (stack, architecture, structure, conventions, testing, integrations, concerns) for mapping existing codebases.

### Phase 2: Map Codebase Command
**Goal:** Build /gsd:map-codebase with parallel Explore agents
**Plans:** 2/2 complete
**Completed:** 2025-12-17

Implemented parallel Explore agent orchestration for comprehensive codebase analysis, outputting to `.planning/codebase/`.

### Phase 3: Integration
**Goal:** Wire brownfield support into existing GSD workflows
**Plans:** 1/1 complete
**Completed:** 2025-12-17

Integrated codebase mapping into new-project workflow with automatic detection and context loading during planning.

### Phase 4: Plan-Phase Optimizations
**Goal:** Reduce context usage in /gsd:plan-phase by ~37%
**Plans:** 2/2 complete
**Completed:** 2025-12-29

Achieved 37% context reduction through file consolidation, verbosity reduction, and workflow streamlining.

### Phase 5: TDD Instructions
**Goal:** Add TDD guidance for test-driven development
**Plans:** 2/2 complete
**Completed:** 2025-12-31

Created tdd.md reference with RED-GREEN-REFACTOR cycle support and integrated TDD detection into planning workflow.

### Phase 6: Frontmatter System Upgrade
**Goal:** Add YAML frontmatter to SUMMARY.md for automatic context assembly
**Plans:** 2/2 complete
**Completed:** 2026-01-05

Implemented dependency graph system with transitive closure for intelligent context selection, eliminating guesswork in planning.

### Phase 7: Backfill Existing Summaries
**Goal:** Backfill YAML frontmatter to Phase 1-6 summaries
**Plans:** 1/1 complete
**Completed:** 2026-01-05

Applied frontmatter to all 10 historical summaries, enabling intelligent context assembly for past phases.

### Phase 8: Improve Roadmap System
**Goal:** Enhance milestone management and phase organization
**Plans:** 1/1 complete
**Completed:** 2026-01-05

Implemented decimal phase numbering (7.1, 7.2) for urgent insertions and improved milestone tracking.

### Phase 9: Integrate Verify-Work
**Goal:** Add UAT workflow with phase-scoped issue tracking
**Plans:** 1/1 complete
**Completed:** 2026-01-13

Created verify-work and plan-fix commands for systematic user acceptance testing with phase-scoped issue management.
